# Implementation_Of_CAN_In_Vehicle_Safety
This project implements CAN for a robust, low-power, real-time system using ARM Cortex M4. Sensors used: Rain sensor for water detection, Ultrasonic for obstacle sensing, RFID for vehicle authentication, and DHT22 for temperature/humidity. STM32F407G-DISC1 enables CAN-to-CAN communication, transmitting sensor data and displaying it on an LCD.
